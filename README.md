Welcome to Colorado Trails!


About this Gem:

The intention for this gem was to connect my love for the outdoors with my love for code. 
In the app, you will have the opportunity to explore Colorado's Top20 trails in a variety of categories. 
Once you picked a specific trail, more detailed information about said trail will be displayed. 


Install Instructions:
